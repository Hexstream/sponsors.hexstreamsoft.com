        <p>Dear LispWorks, Dear Usha, Dear Franz, Dear Jans,</p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest divisions within the Common Lisp community remains largely unacknowledged. That is <strong>the division between <em>Open Source and Proprietary</em></strong>.
          <br />
          There is tremendous untapped, latent energy to unlock to help make Common Lisp successful, and we just need a slight paradigm shift to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a class="tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">We can make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040</a>, and this will be much easier to achieve if we unify our forces.
          <br />
          <strong><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">Through my work</a>, I am working to dramatically expand the Common Lisp community, which is guaranteed to greatly benefit your business</strong>.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>You could boost my productivity almost beyond imagination just by providing me a tiny fraction of a normal salary!</strong>
          <br />
          For instance, 1000$/month would be basically infinite money in my current situation. How about you each contribute 500$/month for 6 months as a trial?
          <br />
          Of course, please consider starting with a large donation to the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> before <strong>10 december 2020</strong>, as GitHub will double your contribution!
        </p>

        <p>
          I also urge you to open source more of your technology, not even necessarily out of pure generosity, but simply because it makes so much business sense!
          <br />
          For instance, you could send SHOCKWAVES throughout the world simply by open sourcing <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html" target="_blank">CAPI</a> and <a href="https://allegrograph.com/products/allegrograph/" target="_blank">AllegroGraph</a>!
          <br />
          Inherently, the more you open source, the more you stand to benefit from the great Open Source Marketing Machine!
        </p>

        <p>In fact, I almost wonder if you should also open source LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp and transform yourself into a services company like Red Hat? It's really hard to compete with world-class open source implementations like <a href="http://sbcl.org/" target="_blank">SBCL</a> these days. But obviously, this would be a more long-term project, and I don't presume to understand your business better than you do or tell you what to do. I'm just suggesting ideas. We stand to greatly benefit from a healthy exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p>
          Please check out the details about <a href="../about/" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft Sponsors</a>. I think you may find them very compelling.
          <br />
          You are obviously eligible for <a href="../about/#perks" target="_blank">Advanced Perks</a>, including <a href="../about/#lifetime-perks" target="_blank">Lifetime Perks</a>. These grant you great visibility on <a href="" target="_blank">HexstreamSoft</a>, <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">the #1 Common Lisp site</a>!

        <p>Dear Common Lisp Foundation, Dear Dave,</p>

        <p>Thank you for giving birth to <a href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1041671580957466624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">one of the most important conversations in the Common Lisp community</a>!</p>

        <p>I have reason to believe that your understanding and appreciation for <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">my crucial work within the Common Lisp community</a> has only been growing since this historic event.</p>

        <p>I believe you have the necessary knowledge and resources to be a key ally in <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">leading Common Lisp to unprecedented success</a>.</p>

        <p>You are already managing <a href="https://www.common-lisp.net/" target="_blank">common-lisp.net</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/" target="_blank">cliki.net</a>, both crucial resources. It is time to unify our efforts. I <a class="tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1250142510267224065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">again</a> urge you to move to GitHub, the best open source platform, and the <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> is a great occasion to demonstrate to the world what already ought to be quite obvious: <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is the best code hosting platform, and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is the best open source funding platform! Let's leave <q>avoid success at all costs</q> to Haskell!</p>

        <p>
          I am not sure if your corporate processes in any way allow for such a quick turnaround time, or if you can sanely make an exception, but if in any way possible,
          <br />
          <strong>please make a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> if you wish to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now! Thank you.</strong>

        <p>Dear Paul Graham, Dear Y Combinator,</p>

        <p><a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/" target="_blank">I have been almost entirely dedicating my life to Common Lisp since mid-2006</a> when I discovered Common Lisp, largely thanks to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">your essays</a>, especially <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank">Beating the Averages</a>. After spending 2 weeks reading your essays and researching Common Lisp, I went all-in on Common Lisp and completely abandoned Java. <strong>To this day, this has been the best and most determinant event in my life and I am deeply thanking you for it!</strong></p>

        <p>Basically, I've been running <a href="https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">an unregistered Common Lisp startup</a> for 14 years. I am planning to register in 2022 at the latest. I have finally started experiencing <a href="https://cv.hexstream.expert/#hexstreamsoft-alexa-stats" target="_blank">some visible success</a> this year, as I am finally reaching the interesting point in the exponential curve. <strong>I am requesting your help to further accelerate and embolden this process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, I believe the traditional Y Combinator process would not be a good fit for me, due to various reasons.
          <br />
          I am requesting a fairly insignificant amount of funding compared to your usual investments, but this would completely change my life.
        </p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">I am the chief architect of the looming Common Lisp revolution.</a> The revolution would still happen even if you just decided to watch it unfold from afar, but I thought I would highlight your opportunity to lend it a bit of your vast resources and influence, thereby greatly empowering it. Everyone has much to gain from this happening. This is a traditional win-win-win scenario.</p>

        <p>I trust that your world-class expertise in startups will easily detect the amazing intrinsic value and potential of me and my startup.</p>

          </span>
        </h1>

        <p>Dear Ergodox/ZSA, Dear Erez, Dear Tisha, Dear Florian,</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is truly revolutionary and life-changing! I predict that it (or its close descendants) will remain the best keyboard on the planet for decades to come!</p>

        <p>Thank you for implementing custom labels in <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/planck-ez/layouts/ABWNG/latest/0" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, <a class="tweet" href="https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1237462417577295873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">as I requested</a>. Your email support is truly amazing, and I was surprised to find that indeed, we have already exchanged <strong>more than 100 emails in 9 months!</strong> I greatly value our great relationship, and here is a perfect occasion to go to the next level!</p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is so damn great that I couldn't resist making <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">an advanced presentation for my custom keyboard layout</a>.
          <br />
          You were so impressed with it that you quickly offered to <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/" target="_blank">interview me</a>, and I then proceeded to really pour my soul into that article, with quite impressive results I might say!</p>

        <p>
          The kicker? <strong>I did this while I was already late to launch <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a>! <em>Oh noes!!</em></strong> 🤣
          <br />
          But seriously, I just <em>couldn't wait</em> to share my passion for the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> with the world! That's how goddamn amazing it is!!
        </p>

        <p>I had already been using the TypeMatrix 2030 (a somewhat similar keyboard) for more than a decade, and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> is at least 20x better! It's easy to infer that I'm probably going to stick to the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a> or a close descendant for the next decade at least... As <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#alternative-to-qmk" target="_blank">previously stated</a>, I am planning to build much more powerful alternatives to <a href="https://qmk.fm/" target="_blank">QMK</a>, <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally" target="_blank">Wally</a> and <a href="https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/" target="_blank">Oryx</a>, all written in Common Lisp, of course. Admittedly, it would take at least a few years before I can start working on this, due to <a href="https://roadmap.hexstreamsoft.com/" target="_blank">more pressing priorities</a>. My <a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/hardware/planck-ez/#my-config" target="_blank">awesome Planck EZ layout presentation</a> is already a good first step towards an Oryx alternative, although it is not yet written in Common Lisp. (I would probably only support the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>, since that's the only keyboard I find interesting...) <strong><a href="https://status-quo.hexstream.expert/articles/planck-ez-interview/#stenography" target="_blank">I believe the Planck EZ will be the key to unlocking 100x productivity!</a></strong></p>

        <p>
          I think there is already an inherent and fundamental link between Common Lisp and the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">Planck EZ</a>:
          <br />
          <em>It's only fair to expect that the best programmers would gravitate not only towards the best programming language, but also the <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck" target="_blank">best keyboard</a>!</em>
          <br />
          Thankfully, we have a tremendous opportunity to make that connection even more concrete today!
        </p>

        <p><strong>As such, I would be extremely honored if you made a large donation to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/Hexstream" target="_blank">the Common Lisp Revival 2020 Fundraiser</a> <em>before 10 december 2020</em> to help kickstart the Common Lisp revolution right now!
